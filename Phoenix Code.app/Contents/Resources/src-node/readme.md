This is the main node source folder that is packaged as a resource in the tauri built app.
This can be used to package node related source into the built app.

Contents of this folder are auto updated to `phoenix-desktop/src-tauri/src-node` by build scripts in `phoenix-desktop`.

Running `npm run serve` in `phoenix-desktop` repo will listen for changes in this folder and sync the build if
there are any changes for convenience.
