                        The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world and is broadcast in more than
                        180 countries globally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you are in the United Kingdom, the United States or Uzbekistan, and just about anywhere
                        else you can think of — except for Russia — you will have the option to watch the biggest teams
                        in football.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But at a time when pockets are being squeezed due to the ongoing cost of living crisis, watching
                        live sport, particularly football, from the comfort of your sofa, could be viewed as a luxury
                        item.

                    <p>
                        The Athletic has reported on the rising number of people turning to illegal streaming devices,
                        with nearly five million people in the UK alone — nine per cent of the adult population —
                        watching sport via this method in the six months up to October 2025.

                <p>
                    In the UK and the U.S., multiple subscriptions are required to access the Premier League, Champions
                    League, Major League Soccer and the major European leagues, and they come at a cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Match tickets, the way travel tickets are priced and all the subscriptions that are required are
                    pushing people to breaking point in many cases,” Tom Greatrex, chairman of the Football Supporters’
                    Association (FSA), tells The Athletic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What has always been a very accessible spectator sport has become, in many cases, prohibitively
                    expensive for people. And not that you would condone it, it is not at all surprising that people
                    will use streaming, despite the fact that it is illegal. They will take that risk because watching
                    sport how you should do is just too expensive for them.
                </p>
                    <h3>
                        “If things were priced more appropriately, then perhaps it wouldn’t be as big of an issue as it
                        is now.”
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing to know about the cost of watching live football in the UK is that it begins
                        with paying for a TV Licence. Paid annually, it costs £174.50 ($231), although you can opt to
                        pay £14.54 ($19) a month.

                        As part of UK government legislation, you are required to have a TV Licence if you want to watch
                        or record programmes on a TV as they are broadcast live. Paying the fee also gives you access to
                        the on-demand BBC iPlayer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You do not need a TV Licence to stream Netflix, Prime Video and, among other platforms, YouTube
                        through your TV. If you are caught watching live TV without a licence, then you could face a
                        fine of up to £1,000 ($1,314).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also important to highlight is that the monthly subscription price, whether it is TNT Sports in
                        the UK or Paramount+ in the U.S., unlocks all the live sports content on that particular
                        channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, now that is out of the way and you are already £174.50 down before you’ve even switched on
                        your TV, you won’t be surprised to learn that this is only the first of many payments if you
                        want to consume as much live football as possible in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sky Sports is the main broadcaster of Premier League football in the UK, with at least 215
                        matches screened live in 2025-26 as part of the new domestic TV rights cycle, up from 128
                        fixtures in 2024-25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A rolling 31-day subscription to Sky will set you back £25 a month and you’ll need to add the
                        Sky Sports package to access their live sport offering, which is a further £25 a month,
                        totalling £50 ($66). As well as 215 Premier League fixtures, this will also give you access to
                        33 Bundesliga games a season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if you want to consume a further 52 Premier League fixtures over the course of a campaign,
                        then you will need to sign up to TNT Sports, which is currently £30.99 ($41) a month. This means
                        you will need to spend over £80 ($105) a month to consume top-flight football live in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sky offer a Now TV pass, giving you access to Sky Sports for 24 hours, if you only want to watch
                        one day of live sport, costing a one-off payment of £14.99 ($20). A monthly Now TV pass,
                        meanwhile, costs £34.99 ($46).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I think that the easiest solution, and I know it's very difficult to implement, is that we
                        almost need to return back to a monopolistic view of sports where it is exclusively through one
                        provider,” Paolo Pescatore, a UK-based media and technology analyst at PP Foresight, tells The
                        Athletic, when asked to reflect on the price it costs to watch football and the rise of illegal
                        streaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But in reality, it's going to get a lot more fragmented as Amazon spends more, Netflix builds
                        out the architecture to ensure that they can deliver live sports at scale over their networks,
                        and then you have Disney+ and whoever else comes to the table.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For MLS this season, viewers in the UK and U.S. will firstly need a subscription to Apple TV’s
                        MLS season-pass, costing £12.99 a month in the UK and $14.99 in the U.S.. This included access
                        to all 510 regular season fixtures as well as all the post-season games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, on November 13, Apple announced that, from 2026, MLS will be available without needing
                        to pay an additional fee for the season-pass. NBC and Apple recently unveiled a bundle that
                        combines Apple TV with Peacock for $14.99 (£11) a month, which will give American fans access to
                        the Premier League, MLS and Formula 1 in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fragmentation of live football is more prevalent when it comes to Italy’s Serie A, Spain’s
                        La Liga, France’s Ligue 1 and Germany’s Bundesliga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All 380 Serie A games in the UK are available on DAZN, costing £19.99 ($26) for a monthly
                        subscription, with Paramount+ in the U.S. broadcasting over 400 Italian football matches if you
                        include all Suppercoppa Italiana games and at least 25 Coppa Italia fixtures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fans of Spanish football in the UK can watch 38 La Liga ties via a Disney+ subscription, but
                        will need to pay for Premier Sports — costing £16.99 ($22) a month — to access the remaining 352
                        fixtures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the U.S., a subscription to ESPN Select, priced at $12.99 (£10) a month, includes all 380
                        Spanish league fixtures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remarkably, the Bundesliga has five different broadcasters in the UK. Prime Video has the rights
                        to 68 matches, Sky Sports can show 33 games, the BBC has the rights to 20 games, while YouTube
                        channels ‘The Overlap’ and ‘That’s Football’ both have access to 20 games. The games on YouTube
                        are aired for free.
                    </p>
                    <p>ESPN Select has the rights to broadcast more than 300 Bundesliga matches in America.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ligue 1 in France launched its direct-to-consumer streaming service — named Ligue1+ — at the
                        beginning of this season. It costs £9.99 ($13) a month and includes every match. UK-based
                        viewers, however, will be unable to watch any live games during the 3pm blackout window, but can
                        watch them on demand via the streaming service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fans of French football in America will need to pay for beIN SPORTS, which will give them access
                        to at least four Ligue 1 games a week. This costs $14.99 (£11) a month and is available via all
                        cable providers or Fubo TV.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) is the most fragmented competition in America, with
                        matches being broadcast via CBS Sports, ESPN, Prime Video, ION and NWSL+, whereas in the UK all
                        NWSL+ games are available for free via the NWSL+ platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        England’s Women’s Super League (WSL) is screened by three different providers: Sky Sports, the
                        BBC and the WSL’s YouTube channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ESPN has the rights to 57 WSL games in the U.S., with American fans also being able to watch
                        matches via the league’s YouTube channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The U.S. national teams can be watched on Turner Sports, TNT via HBO Max Stream — costing $10.99
                        (£8) a month — and Peacock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With illegal streaming on the rise, Greatrix believes it would be</p> 
                    
                <h3>“appropriate, rational and sensible” for the price it costs to watch live football at home to be looked at again</h3> 
                
               <p>to ensure that it becomes “less of a temptation” for people to do so illegally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the costs broadcasters are paying to secure live rights are on an upward curve, and the one
                        way they make their money back is through charging a monthly subscription and advertising.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Interestingly, Pescatore believes, at least in the UK, the subscription model, as far as
                        top-flight football is concerned, has plateaued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There probably aren’t any more subscribers to gain just because of the Premier League,” he
                        says. “There is another argument in that why force people to sign up to a bundle as part of a TV
                        service when you can just completely decouple it altogether?

                        “Maybe that's one avenue to go down, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of
                        choosing which live sport you want to watch and pay for instead of paying for access to multiple
                        sports.”

                        No matter how it is dressed up, the fact that more people are turning to illegal streams is
                        rightly a cause for concern for the leagues and broadcasters — yet the fragmented nature of live
                        sport and the price it costs to watch it is clearly a concern for those choosing to watch it
                        illegally.

                        And it is not only a debate that will continue to rumble on, you suspect the illegal streamers
                        are going to become more entrenched as the fragmented nature of live sport, coupled with a cost
                        of living crisis, makes it harder for people to pay to watch.
